# Why?

*If you want to send a mass amount of images to someone or to a channel while still being able to use discord instead of waiting for all the files to be uploaded this is the tool for you.*

2. Code Editor: VSC(recommended), Sublime, Atom etc.

## Set-up: Script

1. Run the `Launch` file and wait for all the packages to be installed.
